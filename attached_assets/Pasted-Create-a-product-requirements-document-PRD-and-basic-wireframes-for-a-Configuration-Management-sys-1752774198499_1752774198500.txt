Create a product requirements document (PRD) and basic wireframes for a Configuration Management system for KaneAI & Test Manager. This will focus on the ability to easily allocate configurations to test cases and test runs and maintain application updates and edits effectively.

Key Components of the Assignment:
Product Requirements Document (PRD):

Introduction: Briefly introduce the purpose of the Configuration Management system within KaneAI.

Goals and Objectives: Clearly state the primary goal (e.g., simplifying allocation of configurations to test cases and test runs, maintaining application updates).

Feature Breakdown: Identify and define key features that should be included in the configuration management system. Features to be considered:

Configuration types (Desktop, Real Device, Virtual Device).

Parameters for each configuration (OS, OS Version, Browser, Device Name, Application, etc.).

We have KaneAI Test cases with configs: 

Desktop: (OS, OS Version, Browser, Browser Version, Resolution[Default]) 

Real device: (OS, Manufacturer, Device Name, OS version, Application[Optional]) 

We also have Test Manager Test Cases with Configs: 

Desktop: (Same as above) 

Real Device: (Same as above) 

Virtual Device: (OS, Browser, Manufacturer, Device Name, OS version) 

Within real devices, there can be 2 types: Public cloud & Private cloud.

Regular expression structure for selecting Manufacturer, Device Name, and OS version for real devices.

Ability to allocate configurations to test cases and test runs.

Application maintenance (updating and editing applications easily).

User Stories: Write out clear user stories for the main personas (e.g., QA Engineers, Development Managers, etc.).

Challenges: Communicate potential challenges and trade-offs in the design or implementation of the feature (e.g., handling large numbers of configurations, ensuring smooth integration with Test Manager to run test executions (automations).

Prioritization: Decide which features need to be prioritized first (e.g., regular expression structure, allocation system, or application maintenance).


Wireframes:

Configuration Management Interface: Provide basic wireframes for the user interface (UI) that allows users to manage configurations. These can be pencil sketches, showing the key elements such as:

A list of existing configurations.

Option to add new configurations (selecting OS, Device, App).

Option to edit or update configurations.

A filter system for easily selecting configurations for test runs.

Application Management: A wireframe for updating and editing application versions within configurations
